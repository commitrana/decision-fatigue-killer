# Decision Fatigue Killer 🧠

A simple Python-based decision-making tool built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
The project helps prioritize tasks by considering **importance, urgency, effort, and time constraints**, and explains *why* a particular decision was chosen.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses OOP principles (classes, methods, encapsulation)
- Calculates a decision score for each option
- Handles tie cases gracefully
- Time-aware decision logic (urgent tasks get priority)
- Provides a clear explanation for the selected decision

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📂 Project Structure
decision-fatigue-killer/
│
├── option.py # Defines the Option class and scoring logic
├── decision_engine.py # Compares options and selects the best one
└── main.py

## 🧠 How It Works
Each option is evaluated based on:
- Importance
- Urgency
- Effort required
- Time left to complete the task

The decision engine calculates a score and selects the option(s) with the highest score.  
If multiple options have the same score, all are returned.

## 📌 Example Use Case
Choosing between:
- Studying for an exam
- Going to the gym
- Watching Netflix  

The app helps decide what to do based on priorities and available time.

## 🌱 Status
This project is a **learning-focused implementation** and will be extended with:
- Web interface
- User input validation
- Advanced tie-breaking logic
